# Territorial.io
This is a modification for the game "territorial.io" i created.<br>
This doesnt have anything that is going to give you an unfair advantage, it's mostly something i created for testing my skills of analyzing obfuscated code. (It's mostly commented)<br>
There are few features, yes, and nothing special. This wont be updated so, in the next update you wont be able to use this.<br>
## Why?
As i said before, just for testing my skills, a challenge for myself. And, since i'm starting 2 new projects, i decided to stop working on this for having more time on my others projects.

I dont encourage creating modifications that give to you an unfair advantage above others.
